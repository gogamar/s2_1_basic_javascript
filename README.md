### S2.1. Basic JavaScript Exercises Project Overview

This project consists of multiple JavaScript modules, each corresponding to a specific exercise. The exercises cover fundamental concepts in JavaScript, including functions, operators, array manipulation, and asynchronous programming.

#### Exercise 1.1: Arrow Functions

Converting traditional functions to arrow functions and using them in classes.

#### Exercise 1.2: Ternary Operator

Implementing conditional logic using the ternary operator.

#### Exercise 1.3: Callbacks

Utilizing callback functions in synchronous and asynchronous contexts.

#### Exercise 1.4: Rest and Spread Operators

Using rest and spread operators for array and object manipulation.

#### Exercise 1.5: Array Transformations

Transforming arrays with methods like map, filter, find, and reduce.

#### Exercise 1.6: Array Loops

Implementing various loop techniques to iterate over arrays and objects.

#### Exercise 1.7: Promises & Async/Await

Managing asynchronous operations with promises and the async/await syntax.

### Modules

Each module is structured to encapsulate the logic for its respective exercise, keeping the code organized by exercises for educational purposes rather than emphasizing reusability.

### Event Listeners

Event listeners are utilized to handle user interactions and trigger specific functionalities within the application, enhancing the overall user experience.
